## 🎯 Objective

Refine the entire storefront UI to match a high-end luxury boutique aesthetic.

This phase focuses strictly on:

- Visual polish
- Typography refinement
- Spacing consistency
- Micro-interactions
- Premium feel

⚠️ Do NOT modify architecture.
⚠️ Do NOT change API logic.
⚠️ Do NOT refactor service layers.
⚠️ Do NOT alter cart logic.
⚠️ Do NOT touch webhook placeholders.

This phase is purely UI refinement.

## 🧠 Brand Positioning Reminder

Ganachery is:

- Premium
- Artisanal
- Gift-focused

- Intentional

Avoid:

## 🎨 Design Refinement Requirements

### 1️⃣ Typography System

Refine:

- Cart drawer
- Header & footer

---

### 2️⃣ Spacing Rhythm

Audit entire layout:

- Consistent vertical spacing between sections

Luxury equals space.

---

### 3️⃣ Product Cards

Refine:

- Image hover effect (subtle zoom or fade)

No flashy animations.

---

### 4️⃣ Product Detail Page

Refine:

Must feel premium.

---

### 5️⃣ Cart Drawer

- Empty cart state design

No heavy box styling.
Keep minimal.

---

### 6️⃣ Micro-Interactions

Add subtle transitions:

Keep motion slow and refined.

Avoid bouncy or playful motion.

---

### 7️⃣ Consistency Audit

Ensure:

- Consistent border radius

No design drift.

---

## 🧱 Optional Enhancements (If Cleanly Implementable)

- Fade-in page transitions
- Skeleton loading shimmer
- Soft divider lines
- Subtle background gradient (very light)
- Section spacing normalization

Do NOT overcomplicate.

---

## 🚫 Do NOT Modify

- GraphQL queries
- Cart logic
- Service layer
- Shopify client
- Environment variables
- Webhook placeholders
- Project folder structure

This is UI-only refinement.

---

## 📌 Completion Checklist

Before completing Phase 7, confirm:

- Typography refined globally
- Spacing consistent
- Product cards polished
- Product page polished
- Cart drawer polished
- Subtle animations added
- No architectural changes made
- No business logic modified

---

## 🏁 Final Deliverable

After implementation, provide:

1. Summary of UI refinements made
2. Confirmation that no backend logic was changed
3. Confirmation that checkout still redirects to Shopify
4. Confirmation that architecture remains intact

Then STOP.

Project status should now be:

✅ Production-structured  
✅ Headless Shopify integrated  
✅ Cart working  
✅ Checkout secure  
✅ Operational pipeline scaffolded  
✅ Luxury UI refined
